			<h3>Tech Blogs and Forums</h3>
			<p>
				In my free time, I like to keep up to date on the newest emerging technologies, from the newest libraries and open-source projects, to the newest gadgets, I like to attempt to remain in the loops as much as possible. Additionally, I am well versed in the use of crowd-sourced programming forums (Stack Overflow/sub-reddits devoted to a programming technology) to help my accomplish my goal.

			<h3>Ice Hockey</h3>
			<p>
					I am an avid Ice Hockey enthusiast, having played 12-years, and being invited to a semi-professional team, I have traversed every level (and position) of play imaginable, from the pro scene, to the local beer league with friends and family.<br>
					Additionally, I was employed as a referee and as a youth coach during my tenure overseas and upon my return to the US. I continue to this day as a volunteer coach for youth hockey when the need arises.
